# AngryWolves
Bukkit plugin to control aggression on wolf spawns

In reality what this plugin does is annoy your players and make them have to think harder to protect their sheep and to not stay out at night.

Chance of changing wolves into angry wolves, sheep into wolves, villagers into angry wolves, hellhound spawning in nether, and there's a fullmoon where spawn rates are increased.

Version 3.1337 *SHOULD* compile and work for Spigot 1.13.2.
